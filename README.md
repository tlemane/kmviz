# kmviz

**kmviz** is a user-friendly web interface for interacting with biological sequence indexes. In a nutshell, it connects to multiple, local or distant, sequence indexes to performs sequence queries. Results can then be explored through *`tables`*, *`plots`*, *`sequence views`*, or even *`maps`* when metadata contains geographical information. Note that representations are fully customizable allowing to make production-grade figures as illustrated below.
