The `Submit` button triggers the query and pops up a notification indicating the progression of your request. Note that it contains a `session-id` to access your results later.

When the request was executed without any issues, you will observe the following alert.

On error, a red alert is shown with an error message. Here the size of the provided sequence is too small for the underlying `Provider`.

!!! Tip
    Quit the page does not stop the request. In other words, you can copy the `session-id` and come later if your request is too long.
