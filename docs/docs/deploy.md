While the default devlopment server ([flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/)) is fine for running **kmviz** locally, it is recommended to use a production-ready server to deploy an instance that can be accessed by several users.

The following WSGI servers have been tested:

* [gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/)
* [fastwsgi](https://github.com/jamesroberts/fastwsgi)
* [socketify](https://docs.socketify.dev/)

## Configuration

The complete documentation relative to **kmviz** deployment is coming soon.
